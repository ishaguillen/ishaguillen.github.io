                        <h2>radiant light of the Gospel, hear our prayer.
Be our guide so that we may grow in faith, hope, and love. 
May we learn to see Christ in the faces of the poor, the lonely, and the suffering,
help us to be faithful and supportive companions to those around us.
Show us the beauty of life with Christ, that we may rise above the struggles of this world.
Help us reach heaven by living like you, virtuous and kind, filled with humility and love. 
May we find strength in Christ and serve Him with joy. Lead us to Christ. Amen.</h2> </div>
